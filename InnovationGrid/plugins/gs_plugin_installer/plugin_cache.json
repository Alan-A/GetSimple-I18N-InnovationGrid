Pages nested deeper than that will be ignored.\r\n\r\n## Change log\r\nVersion 1.4 (Released 9-Nov-2011)\r\n\r\n* Fixed bug that would cause pages not marked for display in the nav to appear anyway\r\n* Added $echo argument to the get_nested_navigation function. It is true by default. Setting it to false will cause the function to return the menu HTML as a string instead of outputting it directly.\r\n* Added an event trigger to clear the cache after a page is deleted.\r\n* Added a check to make sure that a parent page is set to be displayed in the nav before adding any children to it. This should also prevent pages nested deeper than 1 level from mucking up the array.","path":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/plugin\/nested-menus\/256\/","file":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/export\/2085\/256\/nested-menus.zip","downloads":"8790","rating":4.3},{"status":"successful","id":"264","filename_id":"cbcontact_form.php","name":"Contact Form","version":"6.1","category":"Plugin","tags":"contact form, captcha, email, message, smtp, phpmailer","tested_earliest":"3.0","tested_latest":"3.3","updated_date":"January 22, 2016","support_url":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/forum\/topic\/946\/plugin-contact-form-getsimple\/","author_url":"http:\/\/www.cumbe.es\/contact\/","owner":"cumbe","description":"Add a contact form to web site.  \r\n**Features:**\r\n\r\n*    captcha system with reload.\r\n*    works with  &#039;Fancy urls&#039; enabled, too.\r\n*    send email with contact details to one or severals users of admin or emails.  \r\n*    The log is save in data\/other\/logs\/cbcontactform.log  \r\n*    In admin &gt; pages &gt; View contact form logs button.  \r\nIf contacform.log is not, then message: Missing file: &lsquo;contactform.log&rsquo;.  \r\n*    From v5.4.1: is possible remove the logs from admin &gt; plugins &gt; View contact form logs button.  \r\n*    From v5.5: is possible send message from class phpmailer.

(thanks shawn_a)\r\n\r\nHOOKS\r\n----\r\n\r\n* `edit-above-content` = Called above the WYSIWYG editor, and below the Page title box.\r\n\r\n* `register-data` = Registers data to the plugin under the variable given. More information below. Required for some functions.\r\n\r\n* `development-settings` = Called in the development section of the settings page.\r\n\r\n* `dev-####` = Placing &quot;dev-&quot; ahead of any existing tab or sidebar hook hides it while development mode is inactive.\r\n\r\nFILTERS\r\n----\r\n\r\n* `###-exec` = When a user types into the content :[&quot;someitem&quot;]: the filter &quot;someitem-exec&quot; will be fired.\r\n\r\nFUNCTIONS\r\n-----\r\n\r\n* `Toolkit_print( ARRAY )` = Prints out an array within a &lt;pre&gt; tag. Pretty!\r\n\r\n* `Toolkit_array( ARRAY, SEARCH )` = Searches a multidimensional array for a key-name specified in SEARCH. \r\n\r\n* `Toolkit_page( SEARCH ) `= Attempts to find SEARCH in all xml pages, returning the pages and locations if found.\r\n\r\n* `Toolkit_load( SEARCH )` = Loads all items with the key-name SEARCH from data registered to the calling plugin.\r\n\r\n* `Toolkit_form(DATA, TITLE, ARRAY)` = Creates a simple form. More information below.\r\n\r\n* `Toolkit_template( FILE, FOLDER )` = Searches the template for tokens. Returning function calls. More below.\r\n\r\n* `Toolkit_token()` = For use with `Toolkit_template`.\r\n\r\nTEMPLATE FUNCTION SEARCH\r\n----\r\n\r\nBy default, a template search automatically happens when loading up the edit.php file. It will search the currently active template and populate the global variable `$FUNCTION_CALLS` with an array of content function calls and their parameters.\r\n\r\nYou can invoke the search manually with the function `Toolkit_template( FILE, FOLDER )`. Which will then return the array.\r\n\r\nThe search looks for the function `Toolkit_token()`. All functions that connect to the &quot;content&quot; filter will automatically have tokens applied. Call the token within your plugins function if you want it to be visible in the search.\r\n\r\nREGISTER DATA\r\n-----\r\n\r\nYou can register data for your plugins use which small plugin toolkit will handle loading and saving.\r\n\r\nTo do so, add an action same as any other.\r\n\r\n    add_action(&quot;register-data&quot;,&quot;mydata&quot;);\r\n\r\nHowever unlike a regular action, the function call is not a function but a variable. Make sure it is unique as a global variable (&quot;mydata&quot;) will be created and populated with your information.\r\n\r\nThe data will be saved automatically near script close. Data is stored as JSON so standard JSON limitations apply to what can be saved.\r\n\r\nSIMPLE FORM\r\n-----\r\n\r\nYou can create a simple form with this plugin. However first ensure you have registered data.\r\n\r\nLets break it down:\r\n\r\n    Toolkit_form( DATA, TITLE, ARRAY );\r\n\r\n`DATA` refers to your registered data. The form will use this to save its information, under the array key of &quot;FORM&quot;.\r\n\r\n`TITLE` is a string that will appear above your form in h3 format. This is not necessary and you can put nothing in the slot.\r\n\r\n`ARRAY` is an array of values that will make up the forms inputs. The values are as follows:\r\n\r\n-----\r\n* `type` = REQUIRED. Options are &quot;checkbox&quot; &quot;text&quot; &quot;dropdown&quot; &quot;textarea&quot; &quot;hidden&quot;.\r\n\r\n* `name` = REQUIRED. The name of the form element. Will also be the name of the corresponding key in data.\r\n\r\n* `value` = Sets a value for the form element. Also acts as default content. Dropdown types require this to be an array. Each item represents a choice in this case.\r\n\r\n* `label` = String that will be displayed as the form element&#039;s label.\r\n\r\n* `class` = Makes the element of this class.\r\n\r\n* `override` = Currently unused.\r\n\r\n-----\r\nThe function will take care of the save button and the data storage.\r\n An example usage:\r\n\r\n    $form = array(\r\n    array(&quot;type&quot;=&gt;&quot;checkbox&quot;,&quot;name&quot;=&gt;&quot;mycheck&quot;,&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Click me for a good time!&quot;),\r\n    array(&quot;type&quot;=&gt;&quot;text&quot;,&quot;name&quot;=&gt;&quot;mytext&quot;,&quot;value&quot;=&gt;&quot;Write in me!&quot;));\r\n\r\n    Toolkit_form(&quot;mydata&quot;,&quot;This is my form!&quot;,$form);","path":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/plugin\/small-plugin-toolkit\/531\/","file":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/export\/5501\/531\/small-plugin-toolkit.zip","downloads":"5892","rating":4.7},{"status":"successful","id":"768","filename_id":"SpecialPagesExtras.php","name":"I18N Special Pages extras","version":"1.25","category":"Plugin","tags":"field required,field validation,special pages,field info,required,I18N Special Pages,images","tested_earliest":"3.3","tested_latest":"3.3","updated_date":"February 4, 2019","support_url":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/forums\/showthread.php?tid=5653","author_url":"http:\/\/flexphperia.net","owner":"mganko","description":"This plugin allows you to control which special page fields are required, validate fields by regex, it allows you to add additional info text next to field label, add special field types and set some page options like: title label, content label, hide keywords and meta descriptions fields etc\r\n\r\nIt requires I18N Special Pages plugin installed (tested with 1.2.1 version and above).\r\n\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Translations:&lt;\/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;English&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Polish&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Version history:&lt;\/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;1.25 - bug fixes (sometimes multi text is not working correct)&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;1.24 - multiimage field bug fix&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;1.23 - small bug fixes (multi image field, and new CKE editor in GS)&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;1.22 - bug fix (label truncated)&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;1.21 - bug fix (extra settings not loaded when new type of special page just saved)&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;1.20 - bug fix (some servers could not save settings)&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;1.19 - new option: now you can define field size in px or %, some bug fixes&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;1.18 - new option: hide menu field&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;1.17 - new options: show page type title, auto open page options, hide content field&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;1.16 - title field regular expression validation&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;1.15 - new special field type **Multi select list**&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;1.14 - new special field type **Image with thumb** that allows validating selected image by its size , aspect ratio&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;1.13 - new option to turn on better image browser for image fields, in page configuration.

It allows your users to view and annotate over 50 common document and image types on your website without the need to install any office software or browser plugins. To name a few, supported file formats include: PDF and Microsoft Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, Visio diagrams, CAD and raster images (TIFF, JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP).\r\n\r\nGroupDocs.Annotation for Java is a downloadable library designed as a middleware to let developers seamlessly integrate it into their Java apps or websites. The library converts documents to web-compatible content (HTML\/CSS\/images) on the server and then renders it in users&rsquo; web-browsers like a regular web-page. This client-server (or &ldquo;thin client&rdquo;) architecture provides you with the following benefits:\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Cross-platform compatibility.&lt;\/b&gt; Since documents are rendered similar to regular web-pages, they can be viewed and annotated from any web-enabled device with a web-browser. There is no need to install any office software or browser plugins on end users&rsquo; machines. Supported browsers include: Internet Explorer 8+, Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari 5+ and their mobile versions.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Advanced document security.&lt;\/b&gt; Source documents are not downloaded to users&rsquo; machines during annotation sessions and can be rendered in a &ldquo;read-only&rdquo; mode. The library allows you to restrict or disable print, download and text copy options for specific documents to prevent users from unauthorized copying of the documents shared on your website. You can also display watermarks over the shared documents to protect them from screen-grabbing.\r\n\r\nGroupDocs.Annotation for Java comes with a convenient GUI that can be embedded to any web-page along with documents. It allows end users to easily navigate and annotate large multi-page documents in a web-browser. Other benefits include:\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;A comprehensive set of annotation tools:&lt;\/b&gt; sticky notes, text underline\/strikethrough, polyline, rectangle, arrow, redaction, ruler, watermarks, etc.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Multi-user annotation sessions.&lt;\/b&gt; The library allows several users to annotate the same document on your website simultaneously. Users can see each other&rsquo;s annotations, add comments and reply to them in real time.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Support for native Microsoft Word and PDF annotations.&lt;\/b&gt; PDF or Microsoft Word documents annotated online on your website can then be saved along with the added annotations in them for further offline editing. Likewise, PDF and Word documents annotated offline can be imported to GroupDocs.Annotation for online review.","path":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/plugin\/groupdocsannotation-for-java\/942\/","file":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/export\/6355\/942\/groupdocs.annotation-for-java.zip","downloads":"192","rating":0},{"status":"successful","id":"737","filename_id":"news_manager_createpost.php","name":"News Manager CreatePost","version":"0.2","category":"Plugin","tags":"news manager, shortcut, admin, create post","tested_earliest":"3.0","tested_latest":"3.2","updated_date":"November 23, 2013","support_url":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/forums\/showthread.php?tid=3972","author_url":"http:\/\/www.cyberiada.org\/cnb\/","owner":"Carlos","description":"This simple plugin shows a shortcut link in GS Page Management sidebar for quickly creating News Manager posts.\r\n\r\nRequires News Manager plugin.\r\n\r\nIt should work with 2.2.4 and newer updated versions (&lt;http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/plugin\/news-manager-updated\/541\/&gt;)\r\n\r\nGitHub repo: &lt;https:\/\/github.com\/cnb\/News_Manager_CreatePost-getsimplecms&gt;","path":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/plugin\/news-manager-createpost\/737\/","file":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/export\/311\/737\/news-manager-createpost.zip","downloads":"558","rating":5},{"status":"successful","id":"739","filename_id":"image-alignment-classes.php","name":"Image Alignment Classes","version":"1.0","category":"Plugin","tags":"images, themes, developers","tested_earliest":"3.2.3","tested_latest":"3.2.3","updated_date":"November 26, 2013","support_url":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/forums\/showthread.php?tid=5399","author_url":"http:\/\/richjenks.com","owner":"rjenkins1984","description":"# Image Alignment Classes v1.0\r\nby [richjenks.com](http:\/\/richjenks.com)\r\n\r\nCKEditor (the WYSIWYG content editor used by GetSimple) adds inline styles to aligned images in the form of the `float` CSS property.

You can learn more about Nivo Slider from the &lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/dev7studios.com\/plugins\/nivo-slider\/&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;official website&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt; \r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Among the cool features of the Nivo Slider are:&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;You can use image thumbnails for pagination&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Easily customizable display&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Adapts its size to the parent div&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;5 cool themes included&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The existing &lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/plugin\/nanoslider4gs\/637\/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nivo Slider adaptation&lt;\/a&gt; is nice, but it has no integration with i18n_gallery and does not use all Nivo Slider functions...\r\n\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Usage:&lt;\/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Simply select &lt;strong&gt;nivoSlider&lt;\/strong&gt; gallery type on your Gallery page and use it just like any i18n_gallery.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Note that unlike other i18n_gallery types Nivo Slider doesn&#039;t really care about image sizes - it extends to the maximum possible size (parent size).&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;All possible options for Nivo Slider can be changed. (In exception for custom callback functions). Empty field means default value. Complete options reference for options can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/docs.dev7studios.com\/jquery-plugins\/nivo-slider&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;official support page&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning&lt;\/strong&gt;: CSS in the i18n_gallery settings must be switched on!

It creates an iframe on the web-page where it is used and simply transfers all user inputs to the GroupDocs Cloud API.\r\n\r\nUnlike the cloud-based version, this plugin integrates the downloadable GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET library (DLL) into the GetnSimple CMS and allows you to display documents without any cloud API calls, redirections, iframes, etc. The library is designed to be easy to integrate into any ASP.NET app or website. Complemented by this plugin, it is now even easier to deploy GroupDocs.Viewer into your GetSimple website.\r\n\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Key Feature &amp; Benefits&lt;\/h4&gt;\r\n\r\n1. &lt;b&gt;Native text rendering.&lt;\/b&gt; GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET library provides two document rendering modes. The first, rasterizes documents to images. Text, however, is extracted and rendered in a separate layer on top of rasterized backgrounds in this mode. The second, converts documents to pure HTML, CSS and SVG. Whatever mode you choose, documents are rendered as real text files, allowing users to search for, select and copy text right from documents embedded to a web-page. Native text rendering also ensures fonts always look clear and sharp.\r\n\r\n2. &lt;b&gt;Cross-Platform Compatibility.&lt;\/b&gt; Documents rendered with GroupDocs.Viewer can be viewed from any web-enabled device, including mobiles and tablets. Also, there is no need to install 3rd party software or plugins client-side. You just embed documents into a web-page and users can view them right away using any common web-browser.\r\n\r\n3. &lt;b&gt;User Friendly Interface.&lt;\/b&gt; The viewer comes with a convenient UI that can be embedded to web-pages and allows users to easily browse large documents in a web-browser. When viewing documents through the interface, users can turn pages like slides, preview them with thumbnails, zoom in\/out of a document, download and print documents right from browser, etc.","path":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/plugin\/groupdocsviewer-for-net-html5-document-viewer\/857\/","file":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/export\/6355\/857\/groupdocs.viewer-for-.net-html5-document-viewer.zip","downloads":"753","rating":0},{"status":"successful","id":"858","filename_id":"ExtraGallery.php","name":"Extra Gallery","version":"1.09","category":"Plugin","tags":"gallery,multi language,cropping,thumbnail,images,galleries,extra","tested_earliest":"3.3","tested_latest":"3.3","updated_date":"February 22, 2018","support_url":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/forums\/showthread.php?tid=6761","author_url":"http:\/\/flexphperia.net\/","owner":"mganko","description":"Extra Gallery is a backend plugin for creating galleries, with advanced features like: custom fields, thumbnails cropping, multi language content, easy image browsing.

This Option is enabled by default.\r\n\r\nYou can use this icons very easy within your scroll-to-top button. Just paste the special icon code into the defined field. Example : fa fa-chevron-up. Other combinations are possible too, like this example : fa fa-chevron-up fa-3x pull-left fa-border.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Twitter Bootstrap with your theme, you can surely use all glyphicons too.\r\n\r\n**Scroll-To-Content Function**\r\n\r\nThis plugin is able to find anchors within the content of your site. With anchors you can grant your visitors a comfortable way to scroll fast to content sections of interest within large contents.\r\n\r\nFor example you could apply an table of contents at the top of an article, so your visitors can jump fast to the defined content anchors. This works also without this plugin. The plugin grants only the shiny animation :) .\r\n\r\nAnchorpoints can easy defined with help from the getsimples ckeditor anchor-button. Linking to these anchors can be done with the ckeditors link-button in submenu anchor of this site. The plugins animation works from top to bottom as well as bottom to top.\r\n\r\nIf your editor has no anchor button, you can set anchors manually. A anchor is defined by an empty link with ID. The definded anchors can be selected by klicking on the add link button and choose link to anchor in the text.\r\n\r\nExample : &amp;lt;a id=&quot;heading1&quot; name=&quot;heading1&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;\/a&amp;gt;\r\n\r\nCurrent version : 1.0.5\r\n\r\n== Changelog ==\r\n\r\nv. 1.0.5\r\n\r\n* Added: More info @ infopage\r\n* Added: Some translations\r\n* Fixed: A bug with the preview button\r\n* Fixed: UI tweaks\r\n\r\nv. 1.0.4\r\n\r\n* Added: Redo function\r\n* Added: Information page\r\n* Added: English language file\r\n* Fixed: Some smaller bugs\r\n\r\nv. 1.0.3\r\n\r\n* Added: jQuery.localScroll 1.3.5\r\n* Added: jQuery.scrollTo 1.4.14\r\n* Added: Color picker function\r\n* Added: Preview background switcher\r\n* Fixed: More bugs\r\n\r\nv. 1.0.2\r\n\r\n* Added: Button opacity option\r\n* Added: Button color option\r\n* Added: Button live preview\r\n* Added: FontAwesome option\r\n* Fixed: Some bugs\r\n\r\nv. 1.0.1\r\n\r\n* Added: Button icon option\r\n* Added: Button CSS option\r\n* Added: Button text option\r\n* Added: Animation types\r\n* Added: Animation delay function\r\n* Added: jQuery Easing v1.3\r\n* Added: German language file\r\n\r\nv. 1.0.0\r\n\r\n* First stable version","path":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/plugin\/scroll-me-up\/883\/","file":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/export\/19455\/883\/scroll-me-up.zip","downloads":"974","rating":4.8},{"status":"successful","id":"891","filename_id":"mod1fy_dlmanager.php","name":"Download Manager by Mod1fy.net","version":"1.0.5","category":"Plugin","tags":"download,files,manager,count,logs,no,hotlinking,stats,shortcodes","tested_earliest":"3.0","tested_latest":"3.3","updated_date":"January 9, 2015","support_url":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/forums\/showthread.php?tid=7011","author_url":"http:\/\/mod1fy.net\/","owner":"dennis_maassen","description":"Download Manager for GetSimple\r\n===============================\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLinks :\r\n--------\r\n\r\n[Support forum thread](http:\/\/get-simple.info\/forums\/showthread.php?tid=7011 &quot;GetSimple Forum&quot;)\r\n\r\n[Demo](http:\/\/mod1fy.net\/gsplugins\/ &quot;Mod1fy.net&quot;)\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAfter plugin activation :\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nAfter activation of this plugin there will be generated a new template file in your current themes root directory called **&quot;download_manager.php&quot;** .\r\n\r\nGo to **pages tab** and create a **new page**.

It is a multi-format, web-oriented document annotation library that allows users to view, securely share and annotate over 50 document and image types using only a web-browser. Once installed, you will be able to embed documents along with a convenient document view and annotation UI to any page on your website. Key features include:\r\n\r\n1. &lt;b&gt;Support for all common document and image types:&lt;\/b&gt; users can view\/annotate PDF &amp; Microsoft Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, Outlook messages, Project files, Visio diagrams, as well as files in OpenDocument formats, TXT, RTF, CSV, CAD and raster images (TIFF, PNG, JPEG, GIF, BMP).\r\n\r\n2. &lt;b&gt;Platform independent:&lt;\/b&gt; documents embedded to your website using the GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET library, can be viewed and annotated from any web-enabled device with a regular browser. Your website visitors don&rsquo;t have to install any office software. Supported browsers include: Chrome, FireFox, Opera, Safari5+, IE8+ and their mobile versions.\r\n\r\n3. &lt;b&gt;Collaborative annotation workflows:&lt;\/b&gt; joined annotation sessions allow multiple users to review and annotate the same document at a time. Each can see others&rsquo; comments and reply to them in real time. Annotated documents can be printed out or exported to PDF with annotations in them. Besides, annotations placed online on a Word or PDF document are compatible with native Microsoft Word or PDF annotations respectively. This allows your visitors to save Word\/PDF documents annotated on your website with the added annotations for further offline editing.\r\n\r\n4. &lt;b&gt;Secure document sharing:&lt;\/b&gt; the GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET library doesn&rsquo;t download original documents to your visitors machines during view\/annotation sessions, which prevents potential security flaws. The library converts documents that you embed to your website to a combination of HTML markup, CSS, images and JS, and then renders these on user web-browsers. The download, print and copy\/paste options available by default in the UI, can be easily disabled. This allows you to prevent unauthorized copying of your content, while still sharing your documents on the website. For enhanced security, you can also add watermarks and redact text\/images in the documents you share.\r\n\r\n5. &lt;b&gt;Keep your documents in-house:&lt;\/b&gt; unlike the &lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/plugin\/groupdocs-documents-annotation\/578\/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cloud-based version&lt;\/a&gt; released earlier, this plugin integrates the downloadable .NET library, which can be deployed on-premises.

ItemManager&rsquo;s powerful API is very easy and enjoyable.\r\n\r\nDesign any type of product lists (items), search and filter through the items lists by using flexible API functions.\r\nYou can create a random set of categories and fields, each category is assigned any number of fields and each item is\r\nassigned to one category, that represent the underlying data structure of ItemManager, which allows a countless design\r\ncombinations.\r\n\r\nIf you plan to create a new GetSimple plugin: a blog, shopping cart, user management or just a simple script, be sure that ItemManager helps you to achieve your goals. Stop wasting your time and effort reinventing the wheel. ItemManager takes care of the basic data management, getter, setter methods and all XML data storage processes for your plugin properties, while you can keep your focus on more important matters like the plugin architecture. \r\n\r\n**What can be achieved with ItemManager?**\r\n\r\nThe use of ItemManager allows a very variable field of application, ItemManager can be used to create tools and\r\nplugins:\r\n\r\n- Product -lists, -catalogs\r\n- eCommerce plugins\r\n- Image galleries\r\n- Blogs\r\n- User management tools\r\n- Varios data storage\r\n- Basic data structures for applications and plugins\r\n- Settings and data storages for other plugins\r\n- Depiction of complex Informations in Tables\r\n- Masks, search functions\r\n- Substitutions for small databases\r\n- etc\r\n\r\n## About   \r\nItemManager was born as a fork of Items Manager on May, 2013. IM was written out of the necessity to create a simple \r\nproduct list with images, and has been constantly developed ever since.

With the plugin [I18N Gallery](http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/plugin\/i18n-gallery\/160\/), which is a full GetSimple plugin, you can setup a gallery of images in the backend admin panel, give titles and captions in multiple languages and then choose from one of several internal gallery types for how the images are then actually displayed in the front end, such as Fancybox, S3Slider, etc.  NanoGallery for I18N Gallery is an additional gallery type which you can include in the I18N Gallery plugin for you to then choose.         \r\n           \r\n2.\tNanoGallery for I18N Gallery is a wrapper for the [core nanoGallery implementation](http:\/\/nanogallery.brisbois.fr\/) which is a gallery powered by jQuery with slideshow support, and is fully responsive and supports swipe actions on mobiles\/touch sensitive devices.\r\n\r\n3.\tNote, the core nanoGallery implementation supports both displaying images from a local directory as well from an external store such as Flickr.  But this plugin, NanoGallery for I18N Gallery, as a gallery type plugin for i18n Gallery, only supports displaying images from a local directory, because that is what I18N Gallery does. If you want to source images from an external store such as Flickr, then see GetSimple plugin [nanoGallery4GS](http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/plugin\/nanogallery4gs\/630\/)\r\n\r\n4.\tFor lots of nanoGallery demos see the [core nanoGallery implementation](http:\/\/nanogallery.brisbois.fr\/) page. \r\n\r\n**License**\r\n\r\n* CC BY-NC 3.0. This plugin is naturally totally open source.   The use of the core within is free for private use, but for use in commercial projects or in business environments, you need to purchase a professional license, via the  [core page](http:\/\/nanogallery.brisbois.fr\/).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Config** \r\n\r\n\r\n1. In the i18n Gallery Backend config panel, plugin NanoGallery for I18N Gallery supports the following config from the core nanoGallery, for  thumbnail display \r\n    * Thumbnail width and height and crop .. for more notes see below \r\n    * Thumbnail padding yes\/no, padding colour \r\n    * Thumbnail border width and colour \r\n    * Thumbnail separation\/gutterwidth  \r\n\r\n2. Also in the i18n Gallery Backend config panel, for the main image viewer\r\n    1. Main Viewer toolbar options\r\n        * full  :  Show the full toolbar incl slideshow play\/pause, slidenr, title and description.\r\n        * labelonly : Show the toolbar but just with the title and description   \r\n        * none : Do not show any toolbar \/ any information\r\n    2. Image interval when in slideshow mode\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Setting the thumbnail width and height\r\n\r\n    1. If you define the thumbnail height, but leave width empty, then we get a full width justified layout, where the height of all images on each row is the same, and the width of each image set to fit the image. The height of each row is nominally the height  defined, but a row may differ in height by it expanding to fit the full width of the containing element.\r\n\r\n    2. If you define the thumbnail width, but leave height empty, then we get a vertical cascading layout, where the width of all images is the same, and the height of each image is set to fit the image, with all images stacking vertically in multiple columns.\r\n\r\n    3. If you define both thumbnail width and height, then you can tick crop so each images is cropped to exactly the defined dimensions, if you do not tick crop then each image will be fitted to the defined dimensions while keeping their aspect ratio, so an image may have vertical or horizontal padding depending on the shape.\r\n\r\n4.  The nanoGallery core supports a lot of config, but this plugin NanoGallery for I18N Gallery does not extend all of this to the i18n Gallery Backend config panel, only those above.  Eg no thumb hover effects at the moment.\r\n\r\n5. General config  of plugin  i18n Gallery supported in the (% gallery %) tag  by NanoGallery for I18N Gallery: \r\n    * tags :  Comma separated list of tag words (no spaces).  Only those images in the gallery  that are tagged with all of these words are shown.   \r\n    * thumb  :  Just show one thumb instead of all thumbnails. Specify the index, from 0, of thumbnail to show  \r\n    * id  :  If you have more than one gallery on  a page  then you MUST use this to give a unique id within page.  \r\n    * Eg   : (% gallery name=my-gallery-1 tags=cats,dogs thumb=4 id=g1 %)     -  Just omit a param if not needed.\r\n\r\n6. Note, the plugin [I18N Gallery](http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/plugin\/i18n-gallery\/160\/) has other config to use in the (% gallery %) tag, but may not be supported at the moment by NanoGallery for I18N Gallery. Only those above are definitely supported. \r\n\r\n7.  So let us know if you would like any more of the core or general I18N Gallery config extended &hellip; \r\n\r\n\t\r\n**Changelog and Versions**\r\n\r\n * v1.0  :   First version.

Also the usual GetSimple access functions can also be used: `getPageField($page, &#039;creDate&#039;);` and `returnPageField($page, &#039;creDate&#039;);`\r\n\r\nThe date format defaults to `&#039;Y-m-d H:i&#039;` but this can be changed by adding a `CREDATEFORMAT` entry to `gsconfig.php`, for example:\r\n\r\n`define(&#039;CREDATEFORMAT&#039;,&#039;Y-m-d H:i&#039;); \/\/ ==&gt; 2015-12-31 23:59`","path":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/plugin\/edit-gs-page-dates-plugin-credateshow\/1045\/","file":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/export\/23372\/1045\/edit-gs-page-dates-plugin-credateshow.zip","downloads":"238","rating":5},{"status":"successful","id":"1047","filename_id":"CSSCKeditor.php","name":"CSS CKeditor","version":"0.5","category":"Plugin","tags":"CSS, CKeditor, WYSIWYG","tested_earliest":"3.3","tested_latest":"3.3","updated_date":"June 27, 2016","support_url":"","author_url":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/sergio-guastaferro-5826a171","owner":"Serbian","description":"**CSS CKeditor**\r\n\r\n*Description*\r\nThis plugin is a simple manager that allows you to use a specific CSS style in the CKeditor, offered by GetSimple.\r\nWith it, you can very simply see what do you insert in the page that you editing.\r\nAt the moment it is a beta version.\r\n\r\n*How it&#039;s work?*\r\nBecause the editor has not sense on the not-installed themes, you can select what CSS file selecting using a panel that will be visible in the &#039;settings&#039; section.\r\nYou can select first the theme ( that you are using ) and then the file.\r\nIt is possible also adding more then one Css file.\r\n\r\nSorry for my english :)","path":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/plugin\/css-ckeditor\/1047\/","file":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/export\/15387\/1047\/css-ckeditor.zip","downloads":"745","rating":5},{"status":"successful","id":"1048","filename_id":"aleksmir_math.php","name":"Aleksmir_math","version":"16.07.02","category":"Plugin","tags":"katex latex math show formulas","tested_earliest":"3.3","tested_latest":"3.3","updated_date":"July 1, 2016","support_url":"","author_url":"http:\/\/aleksmir.ru","owner":"aleksmir","description":"Plugin aleksmir_math for GetSimple simple to add mathematical formulas to your pages.

ImForms plugin is modular in&nbsp;design, it has implemented a flexible method for embedding scalable custom form processing modules. An `EmailTransmitter` module for sending emails is built-in as default, but you could extend the plugin by writing your own modules for processing the form data.\r\n\r\nA demo form, created by ImForms: [DEMO](http:\/\/demos.ehret-studio.com\/imforms\/)\r\n\r\n**Features:**\r\n\r\n- Drag and drop interface\r\n- Modular design (scalable)\r\n\r\n**Requirements:**\r\n\r\n1. You will need to have [ItemManager v.2.4.1](http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/plugin\/itemmanager\/936\/) installed to get ImForms running.\r\n2. You have&nbsp;to run&nbsp;at&nbsp;least `PHP&nbsp;5.6.0`&nbsp;on&nbsp;your&nbsp;server.\r\n3. You will need a configured mail server to send and receive emails from your GetSimple website (Note: maybe it won&#039;t work on the local server.)\r\n\r\n##Usage\r\n\r\n**Automatic output:**\r\nThis is the default output method, `get_header()` and `get_page_content()` required in the template file.\r\nThe easiest way to display a form on a specific page is to use `short code`. For instance, the following short code entered in the page editor would add contact form to that page: \r\n\r\n\r\n    [[imforms contact]]\r\n\r\n\r\n**Manually output:**\r\nIf you want&nbsp;more control over the output of your forms, you can do it directly with specific functions call.\r\n\r\nFirst off, to enable manual output set the `$config-&gt;autoFormOutput` variable in your `custom.config.php` file to `false`.\r\nTo get a specific form object, use this code (Ideally, it should be added somewhere at the top of the template.php file):\r\n\r\n\r\n    &lt;?php $form = $imforms-&gt;getForm(&#039;contact&#039;); ?&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nTo output the required javascript libraries and css resources enter the following code inside&nbsp;`head`&nbsp;section of your template.php file:\r\n\r\n\r\n    &lt;?php echo $form-&gt;renderResources(); ?&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nTo show the confirm or error messages to users, use the following code inside the `body` section:\r\n\r\n\r\n    &lt;?php echo $imforms-&gt;renderSection(&#039;Messages&#039;); ?&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nTo display the rendered form output, do this:\r\n\r\n\r\n    &lt;?php echo $form-&gt;render(); ?&gt;","path":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/plugin\/imforms\/1121\/","file":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/export\/7282\/1121\/imforms.zip","downloads":"1345","rating":4.6},{"status":"successful","id":"1125","filename_id":"files-warden.php","name":"Files Warden","version":"1.1","category":"Plugin","tags":"plugin, admin, changes","tested_earliest":"3.1","tested_latest":"3.3","updated_date":"January 3, 2018","support_url":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/forums\/showthread.php?tid=10301","author_url":"http:\/\/ypwm.ru\/about-eng","owner":"szyryanov","description":"Shows changes made on the website.

Accept this change. Check again - no changes.\r\n\r\nWhen you do something with the site (edit pages, install plugins, etc.) it will show  changes made by you. Accept your changes.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time (especially before making changes), check what has changed. If you see strange changes - be afraid! Your site may be infected with a virus. Investigate these suspicious changes. But if there are no unexpected changes, most likely everything is fine.\r\n\r\nClick [+] [-] to expand\/collapse directories. Click the change circle (*) (+) (-) to see change details.\r\n\r\n# How it works\r\n\r\nIt saves a current state (directories and files list with date\/time and size information) into a json file. Next time it compares the saved state and present one. The following changes can are detected:\r\n\r\n- directory added\r\n- directory deleted\r\n- file added\r\n- file edited (data\/time or size changed)\r\n- file deleted\r\n- directory converted to file (with the same name)\r\n- file converted to directory\r\n\r\n# Email notification\r\n\r\nYou can perform a manual changes check every day or every hour... but it&#039;s tedious, is not it? Instead you can setup a cron task (or something similar). The task will call a plugins\/files-warden\/check.php script. For example:\r\n\r\n    curl yoursite.com\/plugins\/files-warden\/check.php\r\n\r\nThe script performs changes check. When changes are detected, it sends e-mail notification and set a &quot;NotificationSent&quot; flag. The next time it will skip the check until the flag is reset. Therefore, it will not send many notifications for the same changes. You should just accept the changes to reset the flag.\r\n\r\nYou can enable the notifications on the plugin&#039;s &quot;SETTINGS&quot; page.","path":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/plugin\/files-warden\/1125\/","file":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/export\/48159\/1125\/files-warden.zip","downloads":"387","rating":5},{"status":"successful","id":"1127","filename_id":"sponsorlogo.php","name":"Sponsor logo","version":"1.1","category":"Plugin","tags":"plugin, sponsor, logo","tested_earliest":"3.1","tested_latest":"3.3","updated_date":"January 8, 2018","support_url":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/forums\/showthread.php?tid=10315","author_url":"","owner":"humulus","description":"If you have a website for a sports club, then maybe you would like to show who your sponsors are.\r\n\r\nWith this plugin you can:\r\n\r\n* show a page with all your sponsor logos.\r\n- show a few random sponsor logos on each page by changing your template.\r\n\r\nHow to use\r\n=========\r\nTo add a page with all your sponsors:\r\n\r\n* Create an empty page.\r\n- Go to the &quot;Pages&quot; tab and select &quot;Sponsor logo Manager&quot; in the sidebar.\r\n- Select &quot;Settings&quot; and set the new page as the &quot;Sponsor page&quot;.\r\n\r\nTo add a random sponsor list, just write\r\n\r\n    &lt;?php c_sponsorlist(); ?&gt; \r\nin your php template file.\r\nThe default is 2 logos.

IPinfo queries \r\ncan be disabled from the plugin&#039;s settings page if desired.\r\n\r\nThe main report page links the IP addresses to the [ARIN Whois\/RDAP](https:\/\/search.arin.net\/rdap\/) search and the latitude \/ \r\nlongitude coordinates to the [OpenStreetMap](https:\/\/www.openstreetmap.org) search. The entire logged dataset can be viewed by \r\nclicking the record&#039;s datestamp field.\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;d like to kick it up a notch, the Very3 Login Security Plugin also creates syslog entries that can be leveraged by \r\nservices such as [Fail2ban](https:\/\/www.fail2ban.org) and [OSSEC](https:\/\/www.ossec.net\/). Bam.\r\n\r\nThe Very3 Login Security Plugin utilizes the GS [*successful-login-start*](http:\/\/get-simple.info\/wiki\/plugins:hooks_filters) \r\nhook and attempts to verify the user name and password hash before completing the authentication flow. If the user does not \r\nexist or the login credentials appear to be bogus, a counter is incremented based on the user&#039;s IP address. Once the count \r\nreaches the configured threshold the plugin disallows any form authentication flow until the set timeout occurs or the block \r\nis cleared from the report page in the GS admin panel. The failed attempt threshold and timeout can be configured from the \r\nplugin&#039;s settings page.","path":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/plugin\/v3lsec-very3-login-security\/1211\/","file":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/export\/57884\/1211\/v3lsec-very3-login-security.zip","downloads":"208","rating":4.3},{"status":"successful","id":"1220","filename_id":"simplebuttoncreator.php","name":"Simple Button Creator","version":"1.0","category":"Plugin","tags":"button creator","tested_earliest":"3.3","tested_latest":"3.3","updated_date":"July 19, 2019","support_url":"","author_url":"http:\/\/multicolor.stargard.pl","owner":"multicolor","description":"This plugin add Button creator on sidebar edit page &quot;Add Button &quot; with several options. \r\n\r\n![alternate text](http:\/\/multicolor.ovh\/getsimple\/simplebtn.jpg)","path":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/plugin\/simple-button-creator\/1220\/","file":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/extend\/export\/51693\/1220\/simple-button-creator.zip","downloads":"247","rating":5},{"status":"successful","id":"1221","filename_id":"my-smtp-contact.php","name":"My SMTP Contact","version":"1.0.7","category":"Plugin","tags":"contact form, contact,  contacts, smtp, form, forms, mail","tested_earliest":"2.01","tested_latest":"3.3","updated_date":"April 9, 2020","support_url":"http:\/\/get-simple.info\/forums\/showthread.php?tid=13675","author_url":"http:\/\/netexplorer.h1n.ru","owner":"denis","description":"This plugin will help you to set up a contact form with captcha and checkbox.
