# InnovationGrid-Theme

This theme is a reworking of the default Innovation theme for the [GetSimple CMS](http://get-simple.info).
The Theme is responsive and uses Grid and Flex CSS techniques instead of the skeleton CSS used by the [Responsive Innovation](http://get-simple.info/extend/theme/responsive-innovation/615/) theme.

The theme has four different layouts according to the width of the browser window and the widest has a right-hand sidebar as in the default Innovation theme. Two layout - i.e. grid - files are provided, one for two sidebar elements and one for three. The grid file which is active is specified by commenting in/out the relevant .css file in the default template.php template file.
